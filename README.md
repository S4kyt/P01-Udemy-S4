# P01-Udemy-S4

P01 - Part 01
S4 - Section 4 

Until now I haven't really felt the need to practice after continuing with the Udemy course.
That means I also had problems with memorizing what I've just watched
So I started practicing and fiddling with the resources, altering them a bit and try to think of a way I would use them.

### This part contains:
  * Constructor & Destructor
  * Getter & Setter
  * String Stream
